# Game Design Methodology

## Prompt

```text 

Your goal is to develop an interactive card game where players are components of an Agentic AI system, the game will have project goals,and an example of game play. Include any other details to help fine tune the game play so that you can build out the game. The game will be  used in a workshop setting.

# Interactive Card Game Design: Agentic AI System
### Project Goals
 Agents work together to develop learning and development solutions.
 - The game will need to have agents , tools, memory, user interactions, llm and reasoning models.
###  Game Play Setting
 - The game will be designed to be played in a workshop setting where participants become the tools ,agents and memory to  interact as the agents  solve problems and develop solutions.

## Example of Play

There must be an orchestrator agent that coordinates the actions of the other agents

Agents will be assigned roles such as Learning Planning Agent, Content Creation Agent, Feedback Analysis Agent, etc.
The agents will have specific abilities that allow them to perform tasks related to learning and development, such as assessing learning needs, developing learning plans, creating content, and analyzing feedback.
Agents will have sample data for the different scenarios they will work on, such as learner profiles, learning objectives, and feedback data.

The game will include various types of cards, such as Agent Cards, Tool Cards, and Memory Cards. Each card will have a description and abilities that define its role in the game.
Provide other example of play and a clarify this outline

## Too Complicatied !

```text
this game seems too complicated . I like the idea of the cards for agent, tools, memory. and that there are agents with specific skill maybe there are some base agents like a web search agent,   a skills evaluator agent , etc lets say at most 6 agent types,  then we need to figure out if the mutli agent next agent selection type there should be a few of those, some knowledge stores I am thinking there will be agents, a number of tools and knowledge on each card.  we need to keep this simple so that a number of people can play the goal is for people to understand the inner workings of an agentic system and play a couple of rounds so they can understand the interactions and postulate what could make the system better. we will need use cards too of user profiles what do you think
```

You're absolutely right — **simplicity is key** for a **workshop-ready card game** that teaches **agentic system thinking**. Stripping the system to its core mechanics while still making it **playable, visual, and educational** will give players just enough structure to internalize how agents interact and where system design matters.

## ✅ Revised Game Concept Overview

### 🧠 Game Goal

Players collaborate (or compete) to simulate an agentic AI system solving a task. Through 1–3 rounds, they’ll experience how agents, tools, and memory interact — and then reflect on what improved or broke down.

---

## 🧩 Core Card Types

### 1. 🧠 **Agent Cards** *(Max 6 Types)*

Each agent has:

* A role (what it's good at)
* Abilities (e.g., "query", "evaluate", "route")
* Built-in strengths/weaknesses (e.g., high reasoning but no memory)
* Input/Output expectations

**Examples**:

| Agent Type             | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Web Search Agent       | Finds current data or context from the web     |
| Skills Evaluator Agent | Assesses user abilities based on goals/data    |
| Plan Builder Agent     | Creates a learning or action plan              |
| Summarizer Agent       | Reduces long input into key points             |
| Memory Agent           | Stores/retrieves relevant facts or prior turns |
| Orchestrator Agent     | Routes input/output and triggers next agents   |

---

### 2. 🛠 **Tool Cards**

Enhance an agent’s abilities for 1 turn or the whole round.

**Examples**:

* Vector Search
* Prompt Optimizer
* Translation Toolkit
* Sentiment Analyzer

Each Tool Card lists:

* Compatible Agent Types
* Input Requirements
* Output Enhancement

---

### 3. 🧠 **Knowledge Cards**

Static or dynamic pieces of knowledge the agents can query.

**Examples**:

* Learning Frameworks (Bloom’s, ZPD, etc.)
* Course Catalog
* Prior User Feedback
* Organizational Goals

---

### 4. 👤 **User Cards (Use Cards)**

Simulated users with goals, skills, and context.

**Example Attributes**:

* Goal: “Upskill in AI Ethics”
* Skill Level: “Beginner”
* Constraint: “Mobile-only access”
* Learning Style Hint: “Visual, narrative”

These cards drive each “scenario round.”

---

## 🎯 Gameplay Structure (Simple & Repeatable)

### 🔁 Each Round (10–15 mins):

1. **Draw 1 User Card** → defines the goal
2. **Choose 1 Starting Agent**
3. **Play up to 3 Agent Cards** (one per player or rotate per round)
4. **Use Tools or Knowledge if needed**
5. **Narrate the outcome and update shared memory**
6. **Debrief: What worked? What failed? What agent was missing?**

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

Players should walk away with:

* A tangible grasp of agent specialization
* The importance of routing, memory, tool choice
* Insight into how to improve an agentic system

---

### 💡 Next Steps

Would you like me to generate:

1. A **starter deck** of 6 Agent Cards (print-ready)?
2. A few **sample User Cards** with learning scenarios?
3. A **simple rules PDF** to playtest this in a 45–60 min workshop?

We can even include a “System Reflection Sheet” for players to sketch improved architectures after playing.

## Print the Rules

```text
can you write the rules up for the simple version of the game that you described please. the one with 1-3 rounds I printed the cards for agents, knowledge and user profiles that is all I had time for
```

Absolutely! Let's refactor the rules to accommodate the user profiles, agents, and knowledge cards you have. We'll ensure the game remains engaging and interactive.

### Agentic AI Card Game Rules (Refactored)
