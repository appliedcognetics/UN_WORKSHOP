# UN Project Sample Data



### Sample Data Needed for the Game
```

 The game will require sample data to simulate real-world scenarios in learning and development. Develop an outline for the different data that will be needed for the game simulator for the given scenario.
```



To support realistic gameplay for your **Agentic AI card game** focused on **Learning & Development (L\&D)**, the simulator will need structured **sample data** that mimics enterprise training and workforce development environments.

Here's a structured outline of the **sample data categories and their contents** to simulate real-world learning and development scenarios:
