# Bloom Taxonomy Overview

Bloom's Taxonomy is a hierarchical framework used to classify and structure educational objectives according to their complexity and specificity. It encompasses three primary domains: cognitive (intellectual processes), affective (emotional responses and attitudes), and psychomotor (physical skills and abilities) [1](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/GlobalDAS/supportability/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE24154CA-D89C-4D81-A512-8C3AB4877143%7D&file=Bloom%27s%20taxonomy.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) [2](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/GlobalDAS/supportability/Readiness/05.Instructional%20Design/Training%20Methodologies/Bloom's%20Taxonomy.html?web=1).

### Cognitive Domain
The cognitive domain focuses on intellectual skills and is divided into six levels:
1. **Remember**: Recognizing and recalling facts (e.g., list, describe, tabulate).
2. **Understand**: Interpreting and summarizing information (e.g., summarize, interpret, predict).
3. **Apply**: Using learned information in practical contexts (e.g., classify, experiment, calculate).
4. **Analyze**: Breaking down information to examine relationships (e.g., order, explain, differentiate).
5. **Evaluate**: Making judgments based on criteria (e.g., rank, assess, conclude).
6. **Create**: Generating new ideas or solutions (e.g., combine, plan, compose) [1](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/GlobalDAS/supportability/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE24154CA-D89C-4D81-A512-8C3AB4877143%7D&file=Bloom%27s%20taxonomy.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) [2](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/GlobalDAS/supportability/Readiness/05.Instructional%20Design/Training%20Methodologies/Bloom's%20Taxonomy.html?web=1).

### Affective Domain
The affective domain involves emotional attitudes, values, and appreciation. It includes levels such as receiving, responding, valuing, organizing, and characterizing by value [1](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/GlobalDAS/supportability/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE24154CA-D89C-4D81-A512-8C3AB4877143%7D&file=Bloom%27s%20taxonomy.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).

### Psychomotor Domain
The psychomotor domain focuses on physical coordination and motor skills. It includes levels such as perception, set, guided response, mechanism, complex overt response, adaptation, and origination [1](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/GlobalDAS/supportability/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE24154CA-D89C-4D81-A512-8C3AB4877143%7D&file=Bloom%27s%20taxonomy.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).

**From the Web**

Bloom's Taxonomy was developed by Benjamin Bloom and his research team in 1956. It is widely recognized and used by educators to define clear and measurable learning objectives, design instructional strategies, and create effective assessments [3](https://www.simplypsychology.org/blooms-taxonomy.html) [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy).

### Historical Development
- **1956**: Original taxonomy focused on the cognitive domain.
- **1964**: Affective model of learning was published.
- **1970s**: Psychomotor model was introduced [3](https://www.simplypsychology.org/blooms-taxonomy.html).

### Key Takeaways
- Bloom's Taxonomy helps in structuring course content and aligning assessments.
- It is used to clarify learning goals and facilitate individualized and effective teaching strategies [3](https://www.simplypsychology.org/blooms-taxonomy.html).

-- I need to develop a set of candidate profiles for the game. These profiles will represent different types of learners or personas that will interact with the Agentic AI system.

For a given industry, country , age and role, create a set of candidate profiles that will be used in the game. Each profile should include relevant details about the learner's background, learning preferences, prior knowledge, challenges, and goals.
