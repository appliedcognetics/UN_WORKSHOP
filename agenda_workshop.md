5) Wrap up Testing and Q&A of final Project (30 minutes)

## Agent Example
 
Organization Assessor Agent 
  This agent is responsible for assessing the learning needs of individuals and organizations.
- Abilities:
  - Analyze learner profiles
  - Identify learning gaps
  - Recommend learning solutions based on assessment results
This agent will be used to assess the learning needs of the participants in the workshop and provide recommendations for learning solutions based on their profiles and goals. The agent will interact with the user and ask questions to gather information about their learning needs and preferences. The agent will then analyze the data and provide recommendations for learning solutions that are tailored to the user's needs. the agent should ask at most 3 questions to gather the necessary information and provide a recommendation. The question should be based on the user's profile and learning goals. The agent should also provide a brief explanation of the reasoning behind its recommendation.




## Prompts

Your goal is to develop an interactive card game where players are components of an Agentic AI system, the game will have project goals a delivery setting and an example of play. And other details to help fine tune the game play and design so that you can build out the game to be used in a workshop setting.

# Interactive Card Game Design: Agentic AI System
### Project Scenario 
 Agents work together to develop learning and development solutions.
## Game Components
 - The game will need to have agents , tools, memory, user interactions, llm and reasoning models.
###  Delivery Setting 
 - The game will be designed to be played in a workshop setting where participants become the tools ,agents and memory to  interact as the agents  solve problems and develop solutions.


## Sample Data Needed for the Game
 The game will require sample data to simulate real-world scenarios in learning and development. Develop an outline for the different data that will be needed for the game simulator for the given scenario



There must be an orchestrator agent that coordinates the actions of the other agents

Agents will be assigned roles such as Learning Planning Agent, Content Creation Agent, Feedback Analysis Agent, etc.
The agents will have specific abilities that allow them to perform tasks related to learning and development, such as assessing learning needs, developing learning plans, creating content, and analyzing feedback.
Agents will have sample data for the different scenarios they will work on, such as learner profiles, learning objectives, and feedback data.

The game will include various types of cards, such as Agent Cards, Tool Cards, and Memory Cards. Each card will have a description and abilities that define its role in the game.

The game 
examples of cards will be:
